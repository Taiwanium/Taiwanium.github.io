                <p>This website was coded in html and CSS. I learned how to code in 
                hmtl and CSS through high school classes
                and taking online coding courses. The purpose of this website is to demonstrate the skills
                I've learned and to display a few of my projects and accomplishments. This website is still in
                a developing state and is not final.</p>
